# TimeClock
A Software Written in NodeJS that acts as a time-tracking system for a company.  With the ability to create a user, login, clock in and out, view users, and change their passwords.

# Pages

# Future Wishes
Things I would add/change in the future with more time:

- Hash user passwords
- Host Application on AWS
- More Admin Controls
- View Time on the users Page (Link to admin)
- Refined Design using bootstrap
